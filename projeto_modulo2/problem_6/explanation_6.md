# for this one i convert first to a list so i can perform an a more simple way the operations, to convert is o(n) and o(n) as well to get the intersection because i have to check the whole input (when I do intersection) so i belive leads to o(2n), when i do union still o(n) to convert, but i belive is o(n) also get the 2 arrays combined and transform it in a set so probably o(n\*\*2)
