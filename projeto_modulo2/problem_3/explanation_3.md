### Design:
<details about implementation such as data structures and algorithms used>
For this problem i decided to use a heap to order and then do the huffman algorithm


### Time Complexity:
<Big O notation with brief explanation>
The time complexity of the Huffman algorithm is O(nlogn). Using a heap to store the weight of each tree, each iteration requires O(logn) time to determine the cheapest weight and insert the new weight. There are O(n) iterations, one for each item.



### Space Complexity:
<Big O notation with brief explanation>
I see the space complexity as O(N) because it depende a lot on the size of input and it can grow as much as the input grows.
