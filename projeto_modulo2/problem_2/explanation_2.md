### Design:
<details about implementation such as data structures and algorithms used>
For this problem I used arrays to return the lists of paths. that way seems a little more organized. 


### Time Complexity:
<Big O notation with brief explanation>

because I have to check for every single possibility do a for 
and call a recusive function with a for inside i belive that is o(n**2)
### Space Complexity:
