### Design:
<details about implementation such as data structures and algorithms used>
for problem for i went simple and i check if user in group. group is an array so is going to be O(n) will check the whole array to find the user.

### Time Complexity:
<Big O notation with brief explanation>
o(n)

### Space Complexity:
